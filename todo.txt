- async cdi injection
-- select() returns CompletionStage (promise)
-- means @Inject too, in which case it's actually not needed if injections are promises
- init
-- fire init events before we open the ports?
-- how to stop init if something goes wrong?
-- how to know all init is done?
-- instead of using init listeners, perhaps inject init providers ?
- better router
- extension methods
- pluggable templates
- define error handler per resource? (for API)
- apparently test/unit has rx TestContext and Async but won't inject them
